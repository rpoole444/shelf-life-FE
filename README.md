## Abstract 

This project is designed to allow users to learn more about popular books that have been recommended from users based on the New York Times Best Sellers. As the user visits the page, a number of Book posters are displayed. The main page also includes a link to view the users favorited books. A user can click on each book poster and a new page will open with all of the book details. Once a user is on the details page, they will see a description, a picture, an option to add and remove a book from the favorites.  When the user chooses to return home, they can click a home button on the top left of the screen (our bookshelf logo). If there is an lag or errors from the server, the app also includes error handling.

## Learning Goals

- Build Backend using Express, Knex, and PostseQL
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

## Wins & Challenges

- Successfully built a full stack app!
- Successfully created app using React framework
- Successfully implemented Router
- Successfully implemented cypress testing to check functionality
- Successfully implemented loading and error handling 

- Creating a fresh custom backend and then manipulating the data using React was a learning curve, but ultimately it was super cool to build a full stack app!
- Implementing cypress was something challenging for us, so getting th syntax correct took additional research. 
- Error was tricky but we were able to add properties to state to handle errors. 
- We would have liked to further this app by beautfying the recommendation page, and cleaning up the functionality.
